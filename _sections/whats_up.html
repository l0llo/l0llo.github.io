<!-- We are happy to announce that our paper <i>Risk-Averse Trust Region Optimization for Reward-Volatility Reduction</i> will soon appear at <a href=https://ijcai20.org>IJCAI 2020</a> Special Track on AI in FinTec! The conference will be virtual this year, hence, if you are going to participate and you are curious about <b>how to safely train an RL algorithm to trade</b>, visit us at the poster, or have a look at the <a href=https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/632>paper</a>. -->
We are happy to announce that our paper <i>Finite Sample Analysis of Mean-Volatility Actor-Critic for Risk-Averse Reinforcement Learning</i> will soon appear at <a href=http://aistats.org/aistats2022/>AISTATS 2022</a>! The conference will be virtual this year, hence, if you are going to participate and you want to understand how <b>risk-averse algorithms can be as sample-efficient as risk-neutral ones</b>, visit us at the poster.</a>
