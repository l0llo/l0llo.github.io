<!-- We are happy to announce that our paper <i>Risk-Averse Trust Region Optimization for Reward-Volatility Reduction</i> will soon appear at <a href=https://ijcai20.org>IJCAI 2020</a> Special Track on AI in FinTec! The conference will be virtual this year, hence, if you are going to participate and you are curious about <b>how to safely train an RL algorithm to trade</b>, visit us at the poster, or have a look at the <a href=https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/632>paper</a>. -->
Two of our latest works on Risk-Averse Reinforcement Learning have been published on the AIJ Special Issue <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/artificial-intelligence/special-issue/10C887PF03L/>Risk-aware Autonomous Systems: Theory and Practice</a>!
