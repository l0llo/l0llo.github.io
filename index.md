## "...l0llo who?"
I'm Lorenzo Bisi, a PhD student at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/home/) and Researcher at [Fondazione ISI](https://www.isi.it/en/home).
I'm passionate about Machine Learning, NLP, Multiagent Systems, Network Science and AI in all its forms.
Currently my research focus is machine learning applied to finance problems.
I like practising [Aikido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido), hiking and playing guitar.

## Work Experience
- Researcher at Fondazione ISI (2018 - Present):
  I'm working on two main problems at the moment: 
  + Supervised Learning for Parameters Calibration in pricing models
  + Reinforcement Learning for optimizing Hedging Strategies. 
  these projects are also the subject of my PhD at Politecnico di Milano. 

- Computer Scientist at Argotec (2017 - 2018)
Research and Development of AI applications for small satellites. These kind of spacecrafts
are rapidly spreading because they are easier to be launched, have a lower cost and can be
reconfigured. However they still lack autonomy and strongly depend on Ground for many of
their activities. AI could enable a greater autonomy in small satellites, but constraints on
computational power, memory, energy and safety have to be respected.

- Developer at Kode (2014 - 2015)

## Studies
- PhD student at Politecnico di Milano - Machine Learning in Finance 

- MS in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano with a thesis on ["Regret Minimization Algorithms for the Follower’s Behavior Identification in Leadership Games"](l0llo.github.io/thesis.pdf). Our research article have been accepted at *UAI 2017* and you can find it [here](http://auai.org/uai2017/proceedings/papers/100.pdf).

- BS in Ingegneria Informatica Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni at Università di Parma with a thesis on ["Design and Development of a IoT based Smart-Camera for efficient surveillance systems](l0llo.github.io/Tesi_Triennale.pdf)

(complete resume [here](l0llo.github.io/cv.pdf))

## Projects
brief description of my [repositories](https://github.com/l0llo?tab=repositories):
