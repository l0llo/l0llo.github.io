## "...l0llo who?" *(Me in a nutshell)*
I'm Lorenzo Bisi, a Computer Scientist and Engineer from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/home/).
I'm passionate about Machine Learning, NLP, Multiagent Systems, Network Science and AI in all its forms.
I like practising [Aikido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido), hiking and playing guitar.
I also have a terrible sense of humor. Don't ask me for a gag or you'll have to gag me.

## Studies

- MS in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano with a thesis on ["Regret Minimization Algorithms for the Follower’s Behavior Identification in Leadership Games"](l0llo.github.io/thesis.pdf). Our research article have been accepted at *UAI 2017* and you can find it [here](http://auai.org/uai2017/proceedings/papers/100.pdf).

- BS in Ingegneria Informatica Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni at Università di Parma with a thesis on ["Design and Development of a IoT based Smart-Camera for efficient surveillance systems](l0llo.github.io/Tesi_Triennale.pdf)

(complete resume [here](l0llo.github.io/cv.pdf))

## Projects
brief description of my [repositories](https://github.com/l0llo?tab=repositories):

- onlineSG: my thesis code, which you can use to reproduce the experiments that you find in my [thesis work](l0llo.github.io/thesis.pdf).

## Gists


- [Classifing Cifar10 images with a Deep CNN](https://gist.github.com/l0llo/8bf60b9cc7487133851f5d920115d21a): a notebook in which I use Tensorflow API to classify [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) images with a Convolutional Neural Network.

- [Il carcere sovrafollato](https://gist.github.com/l0llo/c0fbe7b5bd8834387d73241568d9ec43): a notebook which solves in Python a well-known riddle (sooner or later I will also translate the riddle itself!)
