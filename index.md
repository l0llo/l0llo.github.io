## "...l0llo who?" *(Me in a nutshell)*
I'm Lorenzo Bisi, a Computer Scientist and Engineer from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/home/).
I'm passionate about Machine Learning, NLP, Multiagent Systems, Network Science and AI in all its forms.
I like practising [Aikido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido), hiking and playing guitar.
I also have a terrible sense of humor. Don't ask me for a gag or you'll have to gag me.

## Studies

- MS in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano

- BS in Ingegneria Informatica Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni at Universit√† di Parma

- [Il carcere sovrafollato](https://gist.github.com/l0llo/c0fbe7b5bd8834387d73241568d9ec43): a notebook which resolves in Python a well-known riddle (sooner or later I will also translate the riddle itself!)
